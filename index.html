<h1> iam sundar pichai</h1> <h1>CEO of google</h1>
<h2>hi</h2></>
<p id="para">We’re proud to employ Dreamers at Google. Glad to see the passage of the American Dream and Promise Act to ensure they can stay in the US -- another positive step forward in enacting comprehensive immigration reform!Born and raised in India, Sundar Pichai had a humble upbringing. However, he was a brilliant student from the very beginning and had the opportunity to study at prestigious educational institutions.‎

    He began his professional career with McKinsey & Company before joining Google in 2004. He worked there for about a decade, heading various projects and rising through the ranks.‎
    
    In 2015, Google underwent massive restructuring which eventually led to the creation of Alphabet Inc., which became the parent company of Google. The co-founders of Google Larry Page and Sergey Brin took up the top posts in Alphabet while Sundar Pichai was named as the CEO of Google Inc.
    
    Pichai has been widely praised for his leadership skills and product vision; he is credited with making Android operating system more popular.</p></section>
